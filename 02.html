	<h2>Romance </h2><br>
	<h4>by Edgal Alan Poe</h4> <br>
	
Who loves to nod and sing<br>
With drowsy head and folded wing<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp<em>Among the green leaves as they shake</em><br>
<strong>Far down within some shadowy lake,</strong><br>
<br>
To me a painted paroquet<br>
Hath been—most familiar bird—<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp<em>Taught me my alphabet to say,</em><br>
<strong>To lisp my very earliest word</strong><br>
<br>
While in the wild wood I did lie,<br>
A child—with a most knowing eye.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp<em>Of late, eternal condor years</em><br>
<strong>So shake the very Heaven on high</strong><br>
<br>
With tumult as they thunder by,<br>
I have no time for idle cares<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp<em>Through gazing on the unquiet sky;</em><br>
<strong>And when an hour with calmer wings</strong><br>
<br>
Its down upon my spirit flings,<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp<em>That little time with lyre and rhyme</em><br>
<strong>To while away—forbidden things—</strong><br>
<br>
My heart would feel to be a crime<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp<em>Unless it trembled with the strings.</em><br>
