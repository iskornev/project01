<a class="part1" style="
background-color:lightgrey">

Romance, to nod and sing<br>
With drowsy head and folded wing<br>
Among the green leaves as they shake<br>
Far down within some shadowy lake,<br>
To me a painted paroquet<br>
Hath been-most familiar bird-<br>
Taught me my alhabet to say,<br>
To lisp my very earliest world<br>
While in the wild wood I did lie,<br>
A child—with a most knowing eye.<br></a>



<a class="part2" style="
  
  background-color: royalblue;
"> 
Of late, eternal condor years<br>
So shake the very Haven on high<br>
With tumult as they thunder by,<br>
I have no time for idle cares<br>
Through gazing on the unquiet sky;<br>
And when an hour with calmer wings<br>
Its down upon my spirit flings,<br>
Its down upon my spirit fling<br>
To while away forbidden things—<br>
My heart would feel to be a crime<br>
Unless it trembled with the srings.<br>
Of late, eternal condor years<br>
So shake the very Haven on high<br>
With tumult as they thunder by,<br>
I have no time for idle cares<br>
Through gazing on the unquiet sky;<br>
And when an hour with calmer wings<br>
Its down upon my spirit flings,<br>
Its down upon my spirit fling<br>
To while away forbidden things—<br>
My heart would feel to be a crime<br>
Unless it trembled with the srings.<br></a>
