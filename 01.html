	<h2>Romance </h2><br>
	<h4>by Edgal Alan Poe</h4> <br>
	
&nbspRomance,&nbsp &nbspwho &nbsploves to nod and sing<br>
&nbsp &nbspWith dro&nbsp &nbsp &nbspwsy head and folded wing<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbspAmong th&nbsp &nbsp &nbspe green leaves as they shake<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspFar down&nbsp &nbsp &nbspwithin some shadowy lake,<br>

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspTo me a &nbsp &nbsp &nbsppainted paroquet<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbspHath bee&nbsp &nbsp &nbspn—most familiar bird—<br>
&nbsp &nbspTaught m&nbsp &nbsp &nbspe my alphabet to say,<br>
&nbspTo lisp m&nbsp &nbsp &nbspy very earliest word<br>

&nbspWhile in&nbsp &nbsp &nbspthe wild wood I did lie,<br>
&nbsp &nbspA child—&nbsp &nbsp &nbspwith a most knowing eye.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbspOf late,&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp eternal condor years<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspSo shake&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp the very Heaven on high<br>

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWith tum&nbsp &nbsp &nbspult as they thunder by,<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbspI have n&nbsp &nbsp &nbspo time for idle cares<br>
&nbsp &nbspThrough &nbsp &nbsp &nbspgazing on the unquiet sky;<br>
&nbspAnd when&nbsp &nbsp &nbspan hour with calmer wings<br>

&nbsp &nbspIts down&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp upon my spirit flings,<br>
&nbsp &nbsp That litt&nbsp &nbsp &nbsple time with lyre and rhyme<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspTo whil&nbsp &nbsp &nbspeaway—forbidden things—<br>

&nbsp &nbsp &nbspMy heart&nbsp &nbspwould feel to be a crime<br>
&nbsp &nbspUnless i&nbsp &nbsp &nbspt trembled with the strings.<br>
