<div class="ex2">	
<bdo dir="rtl">Romance,to nod and sing<br>

With drowsy head and folded wing<br>

Among the green leaves as they shake<br>

Far down within some shadowy lake,<br>
To me a painted paroquet<br>

Hath been-most familiar bird-<br>
Taught me my alhabet to say,<br>

To lisp my very earliest world<br>

While in the wild wood I did lie,<br>
A child—with a most knowing eye.<br>
Of late, eternal condor years<br>
So shake the very Haven on high<br>

With tumult as they thunder by,<br>

I have no time for idle cares<br>

Through gazing on the unquiet sky;<br>


And when an hour with calmer wings<br>
Its down upon my spirit flings,<br>
Its down upon my spirit fling<br>
To while away forbidden things—<br>
My heart would feel to be a crime<br>
Unless it trembled with the srings.</bdo><br>
